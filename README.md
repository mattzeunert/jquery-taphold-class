jquery-taphold-class
====================

Add a class to an element that reacts to taphold before taphold is triggered.

    $(element).tapholdClass("active-element-class");

To avoid the class being added while scrolling there is a delay of 120ms.
Once taphold has been triggered the class will be removed from the element.
